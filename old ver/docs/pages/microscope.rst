Microscope 
==========

A physical scanning SQUID microscope is represented by an instance of the :class:`microscope.Microscope` class (or liklely one of its subclasses, like :class:`microscope.SusceptometerMicroscope`). A :class:`Microscope` is a :class:`qcodes.station.Station`, to which we can attach components (instances of :class:`qcodes.Instrument` or its subclasses) whose metadata we would like to save during a measurement.
